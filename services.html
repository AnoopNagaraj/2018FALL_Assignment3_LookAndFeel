                            <p> We’re are going to utilize a body-part split, training 4 times per week. This will allow us to get in the volume that we are looking for while still allowing enough time for recovery. We are going to start the week with a leg day followed by a chest and back day. After a day of rest we will hit another leg day (utilizing different exercises) and cap the week off with an arms and shoulders day (so you can get your pre-weekend pump going!). The weekend days are off days. In the excitement to reach your goals, please do not add extra work on your off days – recovery is very important. </p>

                            <h3>6 months Personalized Training</h3>
                            <p> For the first month, your focus should be on getting active and engaged in the program. A good way to get motivated is to start a workout diary where you can monitor your progress. Write down your starting weight (going forward be sure to weigh yourself at the same time in the morning for consistency), and use a measuring tape to record the size of your chest, waist, hips, thighs and forearms. To stay motivated, keep notes all the way through. If you're more of a visual person, or if you'd rather not deal with numbers, take a picture of yourself every week to track changes. </p>

                            <p>Still here? Good work! Get out the diary (or your camera) again and record your progress. Don't focus too much on weight loss yet—what you should be taking note of is an increase in energy and stamina. Since you've been working out three times a week for four weeks, you should start to feel like you're getting into a routine that's quickly becoming second nature. In your journal, take extra time to write down how you feel, how you're dealing with stress and what you think you are gaining from your exercise program. During month two, you'll pair your aerobic activity with sets of crunches and push-ups, so you can start toning two big target areas.</p>

                            <p>Need a bit of a motivational boost? Write down your latest measurements or take your photo, then flip back to the first page of your journal (or check out that first photo) to see the changes you've made in just a few months. Also, get out your calendar to check how quickly your wedding day is approaching and remind yourself why you're doing all of this. Visualize yourself coming down the aisle in the best shape ever -- and don't give up! Even if you haven't lost weight, you should be seeing some results in your muscle tone by now. This month, we'll crank things up a notch by adding a set of squats to the first two weeks and sets of bicep and tricep curls to the last two.</p>

                            <p>We know it sounds cheesy, but take a moment to congratulate yourself—you're halfway there and you're doing an amazing job! Weigh yourself, take your measurements and snap a photo. If you've been following the program consistently, you definitely should notice some substantial changes by now. We bet even friends and family are starting to notice. (Prepare for compliments to start pouring in soon!) In month four, get ready for chest presses (Google them if you're not sure how to perform them properly).</p>

                            <p>Okay, now it's time to get serious: There are only eight weeks to go until your wedding. Weigh in or snap your photo. Now, where do you still need some help? Is it your stomach? Thighs? Butt? Pick one or two areas and focus, focus, focus. In month five, you'll continue along with the same program, but add in three extra sets of 15 for whichever area(s) you'd like to improve most. With every crunch, squat or curl, envision yourself looking gorgeous in your gown—you'll get there.</p>

                            <p>Can you believe there are just four weeks to go?! As you get closer to your wedding date, your crazy schedule may threaten to derail your exercise program, but do everything you can to stay on track. Weigh in and take your measurements, but don't be surprised if they aren't as important anymore—the way you feel should be motivation enough to keep exercising. You'll continue to workout at the same level as last month. If you're having trouble finding the time to keep up this pace, cut back the number of sets you do, but swap in heavier weights to keep the intensity up. </p>
