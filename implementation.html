            <h2><span class="primary-text">Responsiveness</span></h2>
            <p align="Left">Responsive in website design is using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, a website, to make it adapt and look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones). Furthermore, Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user's behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. The website designed and submitted as part of this assignment complies with the quality of responsiveness.</p>

            <p align="Left">We have achieved the ease of usability by below-
			
<li align="Left">No broken links</li>
<li align="Left">Mobile responsiveness</li>
<li align="Left">Server uptime</li>
<li align="Left">Simplicity</li>

<h2><span class="primary-text">Content</span></h2>
<p align="Left">We have made sure that the content hosted on the website is highly relevant for the fitness users which provide highly credible information.</p>

<h2><span class="primary-text">Design Principles</span></h2>
<p>
<li align="Left">Divine proportions</li>
<p align="Left">We have used the principle of divine proprtions to make sure that menus, forms and other associated form components are complying.</p>
<li align="Left">Simplicity</li>
<p align="Left">Many sites are over-designed, with too many elements on the page, distracting visitors from the purpose of the site. In effective web design, simplicity is significant aspect. Not only does a clean, fresh design make the site easier to navigate, but the aesthetics are more appealing and will stand the test of time. It is unnecessary, as well as distracting, to load a site with design features that don't serve a purpose.Our design is simple so the users can find their way naturally and easily.</p>
<li align="Left">Aesthetically appealing</li>
<p align="Left">Our target customers are gym aspirants. Our design is be crafted explicitly to appeal to that niche.</p>

<li align="Left">Usability and Functionality</li>
<p align="Left">In website design, usability and functionality must drive each decision – outstripping any other design consideration. To achieve a clear, easy, and ultimately, direct path to conversions, both design and technical issues come into play. Every link must function fast, and every button and call to action must be positioned correctly, demanding as little effort as possible for the visitor to move forward to the next step. We have made sure that our website is highly usable and functional.</p>

<li align="Left">Easily Understood</li>
<p align="left">Site visitors must be able to easily understand every word, phrase, and headline without any confusion. One unusual or less commonly used word or phrase will drive them off. Industry-specific terms that are not in common usage will hinder your appeal. Dense, complex content won’t work. Calls to action that are unclear or hard to find will be skipped – and you have one more lost customer. All site content and each visual element must be laid out clearly and cleanly, with all critical conversion points visible above the fold (not requiring scrolling to find). Any deviation merely creates a barrier to conversion. So, we have made sure that our wesite design is wasily understood.</p>

<li align="Left">Design elements inspire users to go deep</li>
<p align="left">Your homepage must have an initial appeal in design and usability. Every design feature is then developed with the specific purpose to inspire the visitor to find out more – and go deeper into your site, and in the end, convert and become a customer. It takes rare skills to achieve this purpose, as well as experience and insight into user behaviors. Nothing should be left to chance – your design should naturally lead them to where you want them to go.</p>
